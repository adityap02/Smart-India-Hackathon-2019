# Healthcare Data Management and Analysis System For ASHA Healthcare Workers

## Overview
This project was developed as a part of the Smart India Hackathon 2019 and won under the Healthcare department. It is designed to facilitate efficient data management and analysis within healthcare settings, leveraging a robust backend database and user interface to manage patient, healthcare worker (ASHA), and doctor data.

## Features
- Patient Management: Handle personal and medical information of patients securely.
- Healthcare Worker Access: Enable ASHAs to access and update patient data.
- Doctor Coordination: Allow doctors to review and update medical records.
- Medical Data Tracking: Record and track updated medical information over time.

## System Architecture
Refer to the UML diagram (123456789.png) for an overview of the database structure, which outlines the relationships between ASHA, PEOPLE, DOCTOR, MEDICAL INFO, and UPDATED MEDICAL INFO entities.
